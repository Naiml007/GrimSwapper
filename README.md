## Support

Should Support Most AE Versions 2016++

Tested On:
* After Effects 2022

If it does not work on your version, please contact me.

## Todo

* Embed ResourceHacker.exe into the main executable to make stand-alone.
* Add more ae version support
* Actually center the UI lol
* change way the program detects the after effects directory, was in a rush so it's a bunch of slow if statements
* right click picture box to save as
* replace ae_splash 2x and 3x too just in case
